## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Dashboard Summaries
The dashboard SHALL show revenue totals, remuneration totals, monthly comparison information, revenue grouping by legal area and revenue type, a monthly financial evolution chart, and a monthly remuneration table by collaborator, with supported summaries reflecting the active dashboard period and employee filters. The main dashboard content SHALL scroll inside a shared scroll container without clipping card borders, and the breakdown legend SHALL present concise participation percentages without redundant phrasing. The dashboard SHALL NOT render the "Visão da firma" badge. The root dashboard component SHALL compose dedicated analytical surface components for metric cards, charts, and remuneration tables instead of concentrating all surface implementations inline.

#### Scenario: Dashboard loads summaries
- **WHEN** dashboard data is available
- **THEN** the system displays high-level totals, current month values, previous month comparisons, legal-area revenue grouping, revenue-type grouping, monthly financial evolution for receitas and remuneracoes, and a monthly remuneration table by collaborator
- **AND** the dashboard does not display the recent activity list

#### Scenario: Dashboard loads filtered summaries
- **WHEN** dashboard filters are active
- **THEN** the system applies the filters consistently to dashboard datasets whose dates, contract areas, revenue types, or employee relationships are relevant to the selected filter

#### Scenario: Dashboard loads filtered remuneration table
- **WHEN** dashboard filters are active
- **THEN** the system applies the filters consistently to the monthly remuneration table wherever dates or employee relationships are relevant to the selected filter

#### Scenario: Dashboard chart spans monthly buckets
- **WHEN** dashboard data is loaded for a period spanning multiple months
- **THEN** the system groups the financial evolution chart by ano e mes
- **AND** the chart exposes separate monthly values for receitas and remuneracoes

#### Scenario: Dashboard remuneration table spans monthly buckets
- **WHEN** dashboard data is loaded for a period spanning multiple months
- **THEN** the system groups remuneration values by collaborator and by ano e mes
- **AND** the table exposes one row per collaborator and one column per month in the selected range

#### Scenario: Filtered period contains months without movement
- **WHEN** the selected dashboard period includes one or more months without matching receitas or remuneracoes
- **THEN** the system keeps those months in the financial evolution series with zero values

#### Scenario: Filtered period contains months without collaborator movement
- **WHEN** the selected dashboard period includes one or more months without matching remunerations for a collaborator already present in the result
- **THEN** the system keeps those month columns in the table
- **AND** the collaborator row shows zero values for those months

#### Scenario: Dashboard remuneration table includes period total
- **WHEN** the monthly remuneration table is displayed
- **THEN** the system shows a total-in-period value for each collaborator based on the visible monthly buckets

#### Scenario: Breakdown charts preserve values
- **WHEN** the dashboard renders legal-area or revenue-type breakdowns
- **THEN** each visualization reflects the same formatted totals and participation percentages returned by the active dashboard summary payload
- **AND** the supporting legend shows each participation value as a concise percentage label

#### Scenario: Dashboard analytical surfaces use shared card wrapper
- **WHEN** the dashboard renders metric cards, charts, or the monthly remuneration table
- **THEN** each analytical surface uses the shared shadcn/ui `Card` component as its outer visual wrapper

#### Scenario: Dashboard analytical surfaces stay componentized
- **WHEN** the dashboard renders metric cards, charts, and the monthly remuneration table
- **THEN** the root dashboard component composes dedicated child components for those analytical surfaces
- **AND** metric-card rendering details remain inside the metric-cards component

#### Scenario: Dashboard scroll stays inside content region
- **WHEN** dashboard content exceeds the available wrapper body height
- **THEN** the dashboard scrolls within a shared scroll container inside the wrapper body
- **AND** chart and card borders remain fully visible while scrolling

#### Scenario: Regular user opens dashboard
- **WHEN** a regular user opens the dashboard
- **THEN** the monthly remuneration table shows only the authenticated user's own scoped remuneration data

#### Scenario: No business records match filters
- **WHEN** the dashboard has no matching business records for the active filters
- **THEN** the system displays zero-value summaries, zeroed chart buckets, and empty-state copy in pt-BR

#### Scenario: No remuneration records match filters
- **WHEN** the dashboard has no matching remuneration records for the active filters
- **THEN** the system displays zero-value summaries as applicable
- **AND** the monthly remuneration table shows an empty-state message in pt-BR

#### Scenario: No breakdown values exist
- **WHEN** the dashboard summary contains no received revenue for legal-area and revenue-type breakdowns
- **THEN** the system shows pt-BR empty-state copy in both breakdown cards instead of rendering misleading chart segments or bars

#### Scenario: No business records exist
- **WHEN** the dashboard has no matching business records
- **THEN** the system displays zero-value summaries, zeroed chart buckets, and empty-state copy in pt-BR
